## Overview

Arbi AI allows you to screen candidates with AI. This guide will help you set up your first screening and start evaluating candidates.

### Before You Start

Before screening candidates, ensure you have:
- Created a project and configured your evaluation rubric
- Prepared your candidates' submission files (resumes, audio/video recordings, or other materials)
- Verified the file formats are supported (.pdf, .doc, .mp3, .mp4, etc.)

You can upload these materials using the "Upload" button in your project dashboard.

Once your data is uploaded, you can start screening candidates.

## Screening Candidates

Before starting your screening process, ensure you have configured your evaluation rubric properly. A well-configured rubric is essential for effective candidate assessment. If you haven't set up your rubric yet, visit our <a href="/essentials/rubric-setup">Rubric Setup Guide</a> first.

To begin screening, select the "Screen Candidate" button and choose a candidate from your uploaded submissions list. The AI will evaluate them based on your configured rubric criteria.

## Evaluating Candidates

After screening, the AI will provide a detailed evaluation report for each candidate. Review this report to understand the candidate's strengths and areas for improvement.

You can also view the AI's evaluation summary and detailed feedback for each candidate. This information will help you make informed hiring decisions.

## Conclusion

By following this guide, you'll be able to effectively screen candidates using Arbi AI. Remember to regularly update your rubric and review your screening results to ensure accurate and consistent evaluations.
